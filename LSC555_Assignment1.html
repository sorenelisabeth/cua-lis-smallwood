<h1 style="color:blue;">System Evaluation: Alexandria Public Library</h1>
<h2 style="color:powderblue;">Introduction</h2>
<p>The information system I chose is the online catalog for my local public library in Alexandria, Virginia, which can be found <a href="https://alxndria.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/home/?">here</a>. The target user is primarily the general public or library card holder, but it is also used by library staff. The system provides catalog records for the library's collections, including bibliographic information such as book title, author, publication details, subject/genre, as well as information for accessing the work: call number, availability, and branch location. It also allows cardholders to log into an account where they can view their current loans and hold information.</p>
<h2 style="color:powderblue;">Discussion</h2>
<p>Alexandria's catalog system is fairly typical for public libraries that I've seen, but I did notice a few interesting features that add some depth to the basic catalog records:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Recommendation Lists:</b> many records have links at the bottom of the page to recommendation lists created by different librarians that relate to that particular item somehow -- either by including it specifically or containing other books of the same genre. It gives the user another way of browsing the collection.</li>
<li><b>External Reviews:</b> some records also include excerpts from (and links to) reviews from trusted sources like Publisher's Weekly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>It fulfills the basic functions of an online catalog: allowing users to browse or search the collection, determine availability of items, and place holds.</li>
<li>The inclusion of recommendation lists linked to related items makes it easier for users to browse the collection</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>The page display is a fixed width that's relatively narrow, which means frequently scrolling.</li>
<li>Doesn't work well on mobile.</li>
<li>Some of the search functions are non-intuitive: for example, if the user conducts an initial search restricted to some subdivision of the collection ("New Arrivals", for instance), selects a record to view, and then clicks on one of the subject tags in that record, the system will only return results within the original subdivision, rather than from the collection as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other suggestions for improvement: I think the catalog records would be easier for users to interpret if they made some formatting changes. The bibliographic data mostly appears as one block of text; adding some visual separation between fields and perhaps making key details like title and author a larger font size might improve readability.</p>
