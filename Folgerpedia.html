<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><a href="http://folgerpedia.folger.edu">Folgerpedia</a>, an open-source encyclopedia that utilizes the MediaWiki platform, is part of a Folger Shakespeare Library information system. Folgerpedia is intended to foster collaboration, organize information, and provide digital resources for researchers, students, teachers, and any enthusiasts of Shakespeare’s works. Its mission is to make “collection accessible, to advance understanding and appreciation of Shakespeare’s writings and the culture of the early modern world, and to preserve and enhance our collection” (Folger Shakespeare Library, 2024).</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Folgerpedia is a platform for Shakespeare-centered information that addresses content that might be too specific, unsuitable, or too archival for other channels within the Folger Institute. Its goal is to facilitate collaboration with scholars affiliated with Folger and beyond. The concept for the Folger Wiki originated when Eric Johnson and Erin Blake identified the necessity for Folger to edit Wikipedia articles related to the institution and its collection. Eventually, Eric Johnson, Erin Blake, and Owen Williams decided to organize information created by the Folger staff and Folger’s users in a Wiki format rather than competing with Wikipedia. </p>
  <p>A significant influence on the creation of Folgerpedia was the <i>Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum User's Guide</i>, published in 1987. This guide sold in the British Museum gift shop was an example of a cultural institution’s internal resources list that was often not mentioned through official channels. For instance, it included a section on prints of costumes stored in large boxes under the title "Authorities for Artists," compiled initially only for artists' reference. Similarly, being a repository of  Folger’s history and Folgres’s member’s reflections on the past is an integral part of the Folger platform.</p>
  <p>Folgerpedia was created by Andru Vallance, whom Yaron Koren of WikiWorks hired in partnership with Folger's Online Strategy Council members. A significant portion of the initial content was transferred from the Folger's public website and Bard Classic by Rachel Stevenson, Erin Blake, Deborah J. Leslie, Sophie Byvik, Claire Dapkiewicz, and Kate Covintree. Folgerpedia was internally launched on July 9, 2014. A few weeks later, a new Folger initiative became available to collaborate and create new content on its media wiki platform and via crowd-sourcing initiatives, such as Edit-a-thons (Folgerpedia, n.d.).</p>

<h3>About the Digital Resources</h3>
<p>The Folgerpedia collection contains books, manuscripts, art objects, bindings, Folger archives, reference images, and microfilm images. This online collection is accessible to the public to edit or encyclopedia entries, as users’ contribution is at its core principle. The articles found on Folgerpedia include “lists; how-tos; and encyclopedic entries concerning items in the collection, Shakespeare's works and characters, and his performance works” (Folgerpedia, 2024). Materials are regularly added to the collection to supplement Folger’s other online catalogs, such as Hamnet and The Finding Aid Database. The often robust information is too detailed to fit within those online databases, which is suitable for the Folgerpedia platform.
“With each new article, we make a concerted effort to pull together all relevant information from Folger’s many existing resources into one place” (Folger, 2024). An example Folgerpedia contains an article about Lady Anne Kerr’s manuscript recipe book that itemizes all the recipes. This is now public scholarly research that will not need to be duplicated.</p>

<h3>The Folgerpedia Interface</h3>
<p>Users can access Folgerpedia by going to the Folger Shakespeare Library website and looking under the research tab or by simply going to the Folgerpedia website, which has its own domain. While The Folger Shakespeare Library website is a tad information-heavy, it is well-organized and consistent with industry standards. Finding the Folgerpedia site on the library’s page can be challenging at first, therefore, the breadcrumb trail to get back to the library website is necessary for usability and efficiency. The interface search bar is conveniently located on the top right corner of the page. The search results page, by default, requires us to select which content is intended to be viewed.</p>

<h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
<p>A heuristic evaluation (Nielsen, 1994) was conducted to evaluate the Folgerpedia user interface for potential improvements and deficiencies or shortcomings in usability</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Visibility of System Status:</b> Very good overall. The search results were retrieved promptly, and the highlighted keywords made the system accessible. When searching for “Romeo,” the first results had Romeo bolded, which helps the user understand their results.</li>
  <img src="romeosearch.png" alt="Romeo search results">
<li><b>Match between System and Real World:</b> Familiar words and language are used to advise the user what to do, appealing to multiple users by utilizing symbolic and world cues. (e.g., the search bar both says search and has the magnifying glass). However, the advanced search bar does not contain a common language and confuses the average user. The system fails in the language of its advanced search feature, where technical jargon, such as template talk, smw/schema talk, rule, MediaWiki, and property, is confusing to average users. Search results filters are supposed to be helpful and straightforward tools to help users narrow down results; conversely, Folgerpedia’s filters would puzzle most users. Additionally, the system lacks FAQs or help pages that could add clarifications.</li>
  <li><b>User Control and Freedom:</b> The absence of breadcrumbs makes navigating the website concerning, considering many articles contain multiple hyperlinks. The user needs to use the back button. Getting back and forth between pages can be challenging and frustrating.</li>
  <li><b>Consistency and Standards:</b> Different color schemes and Folger’s logo on the bottom of the page distort the consistency within Folger’s portfolio. Perhaps maintaining consistency was not the goal in that case.</li>
  <li><b>Error Prevention:</b> The system is not utilizing it enough, as the only error prevention is the user finding a way back to the main library website by clicking the “folger.edu” button in the top left corner. Additionally, there is no exit viewing mode when looking at a manuscript.</li>
  <li><b>Recognition rather than Recall:</b> There are no assistance features that help the user navigate Folgerpedia. An option of hovering over images would be beneficial to the system’s efficiency in finding information. Moreover, an info “i” the user could hover over to help clarify terms used by Folgerpedia would improve the quality of the user interface.</li>
  <li><b>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:</b> The search feature is inefficient. Too many text-heavy results come up simultaneously and load onto the page. The system offers a selection range of how many results are displayed for users to see. Positioning the main tabs (explore, highlights, and digital resources) at the top of the page improves the system’s efficiency.</li>
  <li><b>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:</b> Folgerpedia excels at having a minimalist and professional design. The blue headers with white text, easy-to-read font, and blue underlined text indicating hyperlinks look simple, elegant, and readable. Folger systems do not use this color anywhere else. The placement of images and tables is well-balanced.</li>
  <li><b>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors:</b> There were no error messages or unloadable pages during the usability test. All hyperlinks worked, and the pages were active. Searching for many phrases and words usually resulted in one or more results. If the user searches for an item and no results are found, the system displays information for the user: “Folgerpedia has no article with this title.”</li>
  <li><b>Help and Documentation:</b> Folgerpedia does not offer much support for the users, it lacks an FAQ page, contact us page, or email for users. The only help offered is on the main page, for editors’ use only.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Analysis and Recommendations</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge for the users is navigating the language used on the advanced search and not having any FAQ page or helpful information to reference. Additionally, articles often needing more hyperlinks can be overwhelming for the user; for example, a page with ten hyperlinks creates a challenge in navigating back. The lack of breadcrumbs makes navigating the website too complex, considering articles contain multiple hyperlinks.</p>
<p>Our recommendations for enhancing the usability of Folgerpedia are as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Provide explanations for uncommon or technical terms.</li>
    <li>Have a chatbot, contact us, or FAQ page for users to find simple answers to their questions (in addition to the existing help documentation provided for contributors). </li>
    <li>Reduce hyperlinks by having more organized information on the page. If a page includes hyperlinks, show the trail or breadcrumbs rather than relying solely on the browser's back button.</li>
    <li>The search results page can contain duplicate or very similar results. Similar articles or images should be merged to reduce redundancy.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Folgerpedia website has a plethora of helpful, specialized information that is intended to be outside the main website at Folger Shakespeare Library. There is a need for Folgerpedia and its content to expand further on already existing Shakespeare documents. Its collaborative features make it a unique information system unlike any other in the Shakespeare field. 
A demonstration video or a helpful tools section on the Folgerpedia site to assist new users unfamiliar with MediaWiki tools would considerably benefit the platform’s usability and its efficiency.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Folgerpedia is an exciting, innovative, and relatively easy-to-use platform that enables collaboration between Shakespeare enthusiasts and the generation of new information. Users find Folgerpedia to be a helpful tool for research, study, or teaching because of its reliable information. There is a need for its usability and efficiency correction and improvements, as the system can be unnecessarily confusing to its users as it uses technical jargon, a needless number of hyperlinks, and repetitive results. Folgerpedia would benefit from a system usability test by college students or researchers using the interface. The system uses Wiki software; therefore, an extensive revision might not be possible. Nevertheless, contact us, FAQ page, better accessibility tools, and a demonstrational video would make this interface more user-friendly.</p>
